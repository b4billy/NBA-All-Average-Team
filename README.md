# NBA All Average Team Project

This is a project by David Roycroft and Tyson King, with small contributions by Billy Fryer. We are all students
at North Carolina State University in the Sports Analytics Club there. This project will be presented at the
first ever SAC Poster Competition in April 2021.

The project focuses on the idea of a statistically average NBA Team. The idea stems from the NBA naming All-NBA
teams every year. Especially with lots of teams employing the tanking strategy (notably the 76ers in the mid-2010s
and the Knicks since Carmelo left), we were hoping to see if a statistically average NBA would be competitive
against some of these teams
